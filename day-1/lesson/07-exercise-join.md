# Exercise: Joins

Use the SQL in join.sql to create the simple book database (if you've been following along, you won't need to do this).


# The Exercise:

Write a SQL query for each of the following prompts.

1. Write a query that returns the title and author(s) of every book in our dataset, and does NOT include any authors who have not written a book.

2. Write a query that returns just the title of each book that does not have any reviews. (Hint, use a `WHERE ___ is NULL` clause and an outer join)

3. Write a query that returns just the name of authors who haven't written any books.

4. Write a query that includes the title, author(s), and each review rating, but only for books that have at least one review.

5. Modify your query from #4 to include all books, regardless of whether they have any reviews.
