# Installing, Starting, and Administering MySQL

Database systems have a lot of components, which can make managing a database difficult. Most of the time analysts and programmers are only accessing a database rather than setting one up and maintaining it. However, going through these steps can really help programmers see "under the hood" and understand databases more deeply, which in turn can help in communications with technical support, database administrators, and more.

Additionally, in order to fully explore SQL it helps a lot to have super-user / administrative access to a database. Especially a database that can be deleted and modified without consequences for the business.
