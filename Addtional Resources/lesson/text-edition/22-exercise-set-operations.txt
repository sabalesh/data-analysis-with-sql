# Exercise: Set Operations

1. You've been charged with creating a query that powers a dropdown menu that can be used to SELECT the name of every product individually as well as an option for "all products". Use a union statement to create such a query.

2. Create a query using `WHERE IN` to identify all the lastnames that are shared by an employee and a customer that is an individual (rather than a store).
